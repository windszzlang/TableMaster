In this case, it is the 'Wins' column (C).\n2. **Extract the Wins Data**: From the 'Wins' column, extract the values associated with each rider:\n   - Sylvain Geboers: 3 wins\n   - Roger De Coster: 3 wins\n   - Joel Robert: 1 win\n   - Gaston Rahier: 0 wins\n3. **Convert Wins to Numeric Values**: Ensure that the extracted win values are in a numeric format for calculation.\n4. **Sum the Wins**: Add together all the numeric values of wins:\n   - 3 (Geboers) + 3 (De Coster) + 1 (Robert) + 0 (Rahier)\n5. **Calculate the Total**: Perform the addition to find the total number of wins by Belgian riders.\n6. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the addition to ensure accuracy.\n7. **Present the Result**: Once the total is calculated, prepare to present the final answer as the total wins by Belgian riders.",
